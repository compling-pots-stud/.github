# Collected Works of NLP Students @ U Potsdam

This repository collects some work submitted by students in NLP degree programs at the University of Potsdam, Germany.
Mostly, that is the MSc "Cognitive Systems"; some work is also from the BSc "Computerlinguistik".

See <https://github.com/compling-potsdam> for some teaching material (although most material
unfortunately is in the content management system of the uni and not accessible from the 
outside). See <https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/studium/what-to-study/master/masters-courses-from-a-to-z/cognitive-systems>
for an overview of the CogSys master. 

See <https://clp.ling.uni-potsdam.de> and <https://github.com/clp-research> for more about the research output
of "CoLab Potsdam" (head: Prof. David Schlangen) that is part of NLP Potsdam.
